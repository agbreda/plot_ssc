The main code for plotting 3D maps of water level using sediment concentration as color map is plot_ssc_map.py

This program use some functions/classes from personal libraries egm_lib64.py and egm_plot.py

Input data (water depth and sediment concentration) are in the pickle files depth_2000.pkl and ssc_2000.pkl

Once figures area created, it was used ImageMagick to create the animated gif. Example of command to create it (in Windows)
is in the last line of main program.
